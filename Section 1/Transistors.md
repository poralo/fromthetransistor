## Logic gates :

Logic gates follows a sort of truth table. With 2 inputs you choose an output from the gate. It is composed of several transistors, which put together form a logic gate.

* logic gates schematics : #TODO

### SR Latch :

### D Latch :

### D flip-flop :

### JK flip-flop :

## Emulation :

We can use the Verilog language to describe hardware.  It's a part of basic tools for the design of hard-wired integrated logic systems, whether the final product be built on electrically configurable components (FPGA) or specific integrated circuits (ASIC).

Playground : www.edaplayground.com (sign-up needed)

Need to install icarus verilog to compile Verilog language and GTKWave to see the output signals.

Play with it, we can create 'and', 'or' etc... logical gates to begin with.
